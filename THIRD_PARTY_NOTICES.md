open-source packages, each distributed under its own license:

| PySide6 / Shiboken / Qt (optional, `[gui]`) | Qt for Python GUI | LGPL-3.0; third-party components retain their own licenses |
| PyWinRT / winrt-runtime / Windows.ApplicationModel / Windows.Foundation (optional, `[store]`) | Packaged Windows startup task | MIT |

Refer to each project's distribution for the authoritative license text. The
PySide6 GUI dependency is optional and required for the graphical application.

## Windows binary distributions

Qt is copyright The Qt Company Ltd. and other contributors. Windows packages
include dynamically linked Qt Core, Gui, Widgets and binding-required Network libraries, the Windows
platform/style plugins and PySide6/Shiboken bindings. Qt PDF, virtual keyboard,
QML and other unused plugin bundles are not part of this distribution.

Full license texts, copyright notices and dependency versions are in
`_internal/licenses/LICENSES.txt` in each binary package. Qt 6.11.2 notices are
also available in [the source tree](packaging/licenses/Qt-6.11.2.txt).
Unmodified corresponding sources are available from
[Qt Base 6.11.2](https://github.com/qt/qtbase/tree/v6.11.2) and
[PySide/Shiboken 6.11.2](https://github.com/pyside/pyside-setup/tree/v6.11.2).

You may replace the shared libraries with compatible modified versions and
reverse-engineer the application to debug those modifications. The application
source and build instructions are provided in this repository; rebuild it with
your modified dependency if required. Direct-download EXE distributions do not
lock replacement of these libraries through package signing.
For MSIX distributions, compatible modified builds can be produced from the
published source and installed separately using the developer's own signing
identity. The packaged installation is protected by Windows package integrity;
editing libraries inside a Store-installed package is not supported. The
availability and sufficiency of the corresponding-source and installation
instructions must be reviewed before the first Store submission.

Python and the PyInstaller bootloader retain their own licenses, included in
the same notice file. The bootloader's exception permits distributing this app
under its MIT license.
